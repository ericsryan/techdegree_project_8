Introduction

This program was developed to implement skills that were learned for using Django in order to use Python on the internet. This program will allow users to view a mineral catalog. The mineral catalog is generated from details stored in a .JSON file. The minerals are displayed using templates generated in Django. The user will also be able to search the catalog in several ways.
